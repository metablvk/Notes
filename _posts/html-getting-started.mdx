So what is HTML? HTML stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language, and it's how you structure content
on a web page. For instance you have elements like `<h1>` which stand for level 1 heading elements,
and they go all the way up to 6.

## Basic Elements

In HTML their elements which require an opening and closing tag like so `<element>`, and a closing
element looks like `</element>`. Tags and element terminology tend to be used interchangeable, but a tag speaks
to a single tag like `<p>` is a p tag, and a `<p>i'm a p element</p>` is a complete element because of the closing
tag `</p>`.

### Paragraph Element

A paragraph element is just as it sounds a paragraph which get's marked up on the page.

`<p> I'm a Paragraph </p>`

### h1-h6 Element

A heading element signifies a heading on a page kind of like a newspaper, and the highest level of heading is h1
while the lowest is h6.

A level 1 heading.

`<h1> I'm a Level 1 heading </h1>`

A level 2 heading.

`<h2> I'm a Level 2 heading </h2>`

A level 3 heading.

`<h3> I'm a Level 3 heading </h3>`

A level 4 heading.

`<h4> I'm a Level 4 heading </h4>`

A level 5 heading.

`<h5> I'm a Level 5 heading </h5>`

A level 6 heading.
